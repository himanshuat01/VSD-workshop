Hello all!
As a part of 5-day workshop on VLSI-SOC and design, I'm uploading the contents thought and learnt.

--> Learnt importance of VLSI and Semiconductor Industry.
--> Took an example of ARDUINO microcontroller Board to understand the importance of main 'chip' present on it.
--> There are different types of packaging a chip such as QFN(quad flat no-leads), DIP(dual-in line pacakging), TO packaging and other different types.
'PADS' are also an important component present inside of a chip. It is basically used for flow of signals inside and outside of the chip.
The word 'FOUNDRY' is critical. Performance of all chips are dependant on Founfries.
VLSI engineers communicate with foundries.

'MACROS' are pure digital blocks inside a chip.
Here I'll be speaking few words on ASIC flow of RTL to GDSII
